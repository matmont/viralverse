            <strong>Viral Verse</strong> aims to be a little simulator to study
            how a user-defined virus spread across a toy community. The starting
            point of the simulation is indeed the ‚öôÔ∏è
            <em>
              <strong>City Area</strong>
            </em>
            , expressed as <em>cells-squared</em>. From this value, all the
            other demographic quantities will be computed: the number of
            individuals (here called <em>Population</em>), divided as follows:
            50% <em>Adults</em>, 25% <em>Youngs</em> and 25% <em>Elderly</em>.
            Those are gathered in <em>families</em>, each one composed of 2{" "}
            <em>adults</em>, 1 <em>young</em> and 1 <em>elder</em>. Each{" "}
            <em>family</em> will have an assigned <em>House</em> (

              <li>

            The epidemic model used in the simulation is a version of the SEIRD
            model, where each individual can be in different states: susceptible
            ( <BodyIcon color="#000000" /> ), exposed ({" "}
            <BodyIcon color="#ffc021" /> ), infected ({" "}
            <BodyIcon color="#ba2222" /> ) both asymptomatic or symptomatic, and
            immune ( <BodyIcon color="#12ff3d" /> ). Each epidemic run will
            start with an ‚öôÔ∏è
            <em>
              <strong>Outbreak</strong>
            </em>{" "}
            percentage, i.e., the amount of individuals that will start as{" "}
            <em>infected (asymptomatic)</em>. Furthermore, it is possible to
            select the{" "}
            <em>
              <strong>Virus</strong>
            </em>{" "}
            that will be the subject of the simulation. Note that it is possible
            to create custom <em>viruses</em> with the following customizable
            variables:
          </Text>
          <Text>
            <ul style={{ marginLeft: "4%" }}>
              <li>
                <strong>
                  <em>% Death</em>
                </strong>
                : the mortality rate of the virus.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>
                  <em>% Immunity</em>
                </strong>
                : when an individual recovers from the disease, it has this
                percentage to become <em>immune</em> from the virus.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>
                  <em>% Infection</em>

                : when the individual get infected, it has this percentage to
                develop symptoms (only the symptomatic individuals can die).
              </li>{" "}
              <li>
                <strong>
                  <em>Disease Duration (days)</em>
                </strong>
                : the average duration of the disease.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>
                  <em>Incubation Period (days)</em>
                </strong>
                : amount of days between the first contact to the virus and the
                first day of disease.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </Text>
          <Text>
            Finally, to conclude the epidemic simulation configuration, it is
            possible to set two different containment measures:

            <ul style={{ marginLeft: "4%" }}>

                mask (and it will use it for the whole duration of the
                simulation). Please note that using the mask is not a defense
                against the virus. Instead, it will make sure that the viral
                load left on the cell by an infected one is lowered down.

                : the probability that a user <em>infected</em> and{" "}
                <strong>symptomatic</strong> will stay at its own house, without
                going around spreading the infection.

            Now that the simulation is fully configured, it is possible to üïπÔ∏è
            <strong>Start</strong> (and üïπÔ∏è<strong>Pause</strong>). A simulation
            covers <strong>1 year</strong> of life, risulting in a not trivial
            duration of the interactive view of the process. Hence, it is
            possible to üïπÔ∏è<strong>Fast Forward</strong> the simulation to the
            end, where a user can check at the resulting üìä
            <strong>Charts</strong> of the model run (the action button near
            this <em>Info</em>'s one).
