This project has been developed during the _Computational Models for Complex System (CMCS)_ exam (University of Pisa, Computer Science Master's Degree).

![ViralVerse screenshot](public/screenshot.png)

The idea was to explore how **Agent-Based Models** can be exploited to simulate, understand and analyze real complex systems. The (web) application has been built with [React.js](https://react.dev/) and [AgentScript](https://agentscript.org/) to provide a user-friendly interface where users can define custom viruses and try to simulate them to explore the evolution of the SIR model curves.

The whole theory behind the application can be found [in my blog](https://mmont.dev/).
